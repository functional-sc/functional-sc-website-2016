# Learning Functional Programming

Functional Programming is style of crafting software where functions are the fundamental building blocks. Among other features, this allows programmers to create simpler software for complex problems.

Specific particular programming languages can either help or hinder this style of programming.  The extremes swing from "Purely Functional" to "Imperative".  Most functional programming languages have some imperative facilities and vice-versa.

## Functional Programming In General

The [Functional Thinking](FunctionalThinking) presentation is a good start, although it assumes knowledge of Java semi-technical audiences can fully appreciate the the rationale and flexibility of functional programming.

[Erik Meijer's Presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIUlFQH4Cvo&list=PLoJC20gNfC2gpI7Dl6fg8uj1a-wfnWTH8) are pretty good, the first few are language agnostic.
