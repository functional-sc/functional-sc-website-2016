We'd like to thank [Gerald Jay Sussman](http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~gjs/) for a [great presentation](http://vimeo.com/151465912) here in New York City.

Dr. Sussman is the Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and has been involved in artificial intelligence research at MIT since 1964. His research has centered on understanding the problem-solving strategies used by scientists and engineers, with the goals of automating parts of the process and formalizing it to provide more effective methods of science and engineering education. Sussman has also worked in computer languages, in computer architecture and in VLSI design.
